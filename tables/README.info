This directory contains a set of the precomputed tables required to
perform FC-Gram periodic extensions. Currently the tables in this
directory span all the cases with matching values (O) from 3 to 9
and continuation points (C) from 15 to 34.

Note that a few extra tables which are used to perform spectral 
interpolation betweeen frequent resolutions are also provided in
directory `boots`.

If another combination of parameters is required, it can be generated
using the Fortran program available at:
https://github.com/mfontanaar/fctables.
