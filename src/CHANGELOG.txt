v2.0 - 7/21/21:
- fcgram module moved from `pseudo` to `fftp` and it now incorporates
  all the required datatypes and helper functions.
- New module `boundary` to deal with boudary conditions for each field.
- Solvers renamed to reflect the bulk PDEs they are solving.
- Added new solver `MHD`.
- Poisson solvers for Robin and Dirichlet boundary conditions.
- Boundary (and divergenceless) diagnostic routines in
  `boundary` module.
- Added basic support for FC-Gram in y direction. More work needed
  before solvers with non-periodic boundaries in y are supported.
