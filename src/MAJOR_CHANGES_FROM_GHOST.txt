- No 2/3 rule. Operations are now applied over entire arrays and results are filtered with calls to `fc_filter` when needed.
- Module `boxsize` is now in module `grid`.
- New module `fcgram` with information about continuation points and boundary approximation order.
- Global quantities and spectras are now computed in a mixed (kx,ky,z) domain, as information in fully spectral domains contains the non-physical contribution of the FC-Gram continuation.
- Remove trailing 3 in certain subroutines. New names are  `gradre`, `prodre`, `derivk`, `laplak`, `vector`.
- `rotor` renamed `curlk` for consistency.
- The subroutines that compute non-linear hd terms (`gradre`, `prodre`) return the three components of the result.
- `nonlhd` renamed poisson, and now it returns the inhomogeneous pressure instead of projecting v over solenoidal space inplace.
- New subroutine `pressure` that handles the projection of v into solenoidal space as well as the Neumann conditions for v.
- New subroutine `laplace` that computes the homogeneous solution of Laplace equation for two periodic, 1 non-periodic dimension.
- New output subroutine `diagnostic`` and new text output diagnostic.txt that contains the mean squared value of the divergence in the bulk of the fluid and of the slip velocity and normal velocity at boundaries.
- Normalization routine for vector fields is now called `normvec` and is located in `pseudospec_hd.f90`
